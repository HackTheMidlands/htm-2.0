A great way to learn how to code is by attending a hackathon 👩‍💻 It's an event for like-minded people to share what they are interested in and teach each-other what they are passionate about, whether it's coding, electronics or anything else you want to know about 💡 You never know what new skill you might pick up! You can also ask specific questions to our mentors and other participants in the Discord server 🙋 We’re all here to help!",
